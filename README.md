More information about Postgres may be found here: https://www.postgresql.org/about/ 

	JavaScript - Is a high level interpreted programming language that is mainly used for Web Development along side HTML and CSS. 
		As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.
		More information about JavaScript may be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript
